# Loan-Prediction-Model

#### This Notebook consists of 4 different Models trained for predicting if the Person is eligible for Loan, depending on the information provided in the Dataset

##### Printing the Dataset for checking various variables

###### 1].In the Dataset, we can see that Loan_Status is the Variable we want to predict, using all the variables present in the Dataset. This is where feature selection and feature engineering comes into picture. I have used some basic techniques to process the data in a way, so that we can use the same in our Model.
###### 2].Dealing with Outliers of the Dataset, while looking at the Number of Categorical and Numerical Features of the Dataset are some techniques that can be learned from this Notebook.
We can evaluate the Model on every step of our Progress
